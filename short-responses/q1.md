# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
A middleware function is different from a normal controller in the way that middleware sits in between the client and the Back-End controller. Client requests to our application are first handled and transformed by our Middleware functions in order to ensure data is valid, consistent, and that our server can run safely, predictably, and as desired.
